# Trello UI and API Automation Testing 

---

**Description:**

This project automates UI and API testing for Trello using Selenium WebDriver with Assert Act Arrange (AAA) model and Page Object Model (POM). It also leverages Postman for API testing, Jenkins for continuous integration, and Slack for communication. The repository contains test plans, designs, scripts, and HTML reports.

**Components:**

1. **Selenium WebDriver with AAA Model:**
   - Utilized for UI automation testing following the Assert Act Arrange model.
   - Enhances test readability, maintainability, and reusability.
   - Enables clear separation of test setup, execution, and verification.

2. **Page Object Model (POM):**
   - Implemented to represent web pages as objects, enhancing test maintainability.
   - Provides a structured approach for organizing page elements and actions.
   - Supports easy updates and modifications to UI automation scripts.

3. **Selenium Grid:**
   - Enables parallel execution of tests across multiple machines and browsers.
   - Enhances test execution efficiency and reduces time.

4. **Postman:**
   - Utilized for API testing of Trello endpoints.
   - Supports scripting for complex scenarios.
   - Provides comprehensive test result reporting.

5. **Jenkins:**
   - Used for continuous integration and automation of test executions.
   - Enables scheduling of test runs and integration with version control systems.

6. **Software Test Plan (STP):**
   - Documents the overall testing approach, scope, resources, and schedules.
   - Includes details on test environments, automation tools, and communication channels.

7. **Software Test Design (STD):**
   - Provides detailed test scenarios, cases, and data for UI and API testing.
   - Specifies test conditions, expected results, and validation criteria.

8. **Software Test Report (STR):**
   - Generates HTML reports summarizing test execution results.
   - Includes metrics, graphs, and insights for stakeholders.
   - Enables tracking of defects and test coverage.

9. **Slack Integration:**
   - Facilitates real-time communication and collaboration among team members.
   - Sends notifications for test execution status and results.
   - Provides a centralized platform for discussion and issue resolution.
